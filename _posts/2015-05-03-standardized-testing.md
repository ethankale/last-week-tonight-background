title: Standarized Testing
summary: Kids are filling in more bubbles than ever, but does it actually result in better education?

### Resources
* [Pearson VUE](http://home.pearsonvue.com/Home.aspx) - Test-making behemoth
* Ironically, [Pearson's rankings](http://thelearningcurve.pearson.com/index/index-ranking) of international educational achievement show up first in Google.
* A better source is probably [OECD's PISA](http://www.oecd.org/pisa/keyfindings/).
* The [most recent PISA summary report](http://www.oecd.org/pisa/keyfindings/pisa-2012-results-overview.pdf) shows the US failing to break the top 10 (of 34) in any education attainment category.
* OECD also publishes interesting [US-specific data](http://www.oecd.org/unitedstates/CN%20-%20United%20States.pdf), showing that disproportionately huge efforts by teachers put the United States above the world average in tertiary (college-level) enrollment, but still well behind leaders like Korea and Japan.
* A quick [scholar.google.com](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=standardized+testing&btnG=&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C48) search reveals that there is a lot of published anti-testing literature, but not much assessing the link between testing and achievement (most literature seems to rely on surveys & impressions of teachers).

Special mention should go to the [Center on International Education Benchmarking (CIEB)](http://www.ncee.org/programs-affiliates/center-on-international-education-benchmarking/), a wing of the [National Center on Education and the Economy (NCEE)](http://www.ncee.org/).  CIEB appears to advise the President on educational policy, and is tellingly headed by a strong "standards" advocate, [Marc S. Tucker](http://www.ncee.org/about-ncee/our-people/leadership/marc-s-tucker/).  

Nevertheless, their [flagship report](http://www.oecd.org/pisa/46623978.pdf) (which I have not read in full, only skimmed) includes a valuable comprehensive survey of high-performing countries.  It does back international standards, and presumably the testing that goes along with such standards, but clearly makes the case that improving education also requires "the recruitment, development, rewarding and retaining of effective teachers and principals," and "concerted, system-wide effort(s) that specifically target the learning opportunities of disadvantaged students."

The report does include an excellent quote that encapsulates their findings: "The education development progression (from low to high) is characterised by a movement from relatively low teacher quality to relatively high teacher quality; from a focus on low-level basic skills to a focus on complex high-level skills and creativity; from [Tayloristic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_management) forms of work organisation to professional forms of work organisation; from primary accountability to superiors to primary accountability to one's professional colleagues, parents and the public; and from a belief that only some students can and need to achieve high learning standards to a conviction that all students need to meet such high standards."

In otherwords, the recipe for improving education lies in **employing professional teachers that expect all of their students to do well**.
